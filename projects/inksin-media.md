Inksin Media came to eight&four looking to create a platform to promote their innovative advertising products across two different regions.  Employing the power of a WordPress multisite installation, we were able to build out a scalable network of CMS driven websites which offered complete content control across the website.

Along with a visual refresh and new multilingual platform, we created tools to help Inskin publish content with ease, whilst tailoring the experience for different devices.  I developed a media synchronisation plugin to allow website editors to publish content across both locales without duplicating static files as well as a system to curate the examples shown to different devices (desktop, tablet and mobile) to compliment their targeted advertising techniques.
