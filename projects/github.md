Iâ€™m an active github user and try to contribute open source software when I can.  For me, being part of a wider community is important as the generosity and dedication of others and their willingness to share ideas and software has shaped my learning and career.

## Strava API
My most used and popular open source work has been around the Strava API.  As a keen cyclist I wanted to write a client in PHP so that I could access raw data from my rides.  The approach I took to writing the client was heavily influenced by [insert link to twitter API dude].  By opening up a few basic authentication methods and covering the HTTP verbs, the client is instantly scalable and will continue to work with the web service as it evolves and new endpoints are added.

I enjoy actively maintaining the code and have helped other developers in integrating the client with their own work.  My own uses include various data comparisons such as a yearly progress tracker, but most notably the [Rapha Rising App](/projects/rapha-rising) I created which allowed all Strava users to create an infographic style page out of their rides from the challenge.
