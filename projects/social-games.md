Whilst working at eight&four we planned socials for the rest of the team every month.  I saw this as a great opportunity to develop mobile first web apps to complement the theme of the evening.

## Tour De France Drinking Game
After the finish of the 2013 tour it was pretty clear to me that I’d essentially been speaking to myself when talking about the different jerseys on offer to the riders.  To rectify this, I created a little gamified app to help educate my colleagues on the intricacies of the Tour de France.

I built the app around a WordPress backend to leverage the image upload and editing functionality as well as user authentication.  All players were given a unique pin to access their account and had to check in at the different pub stops on the night to stay in the race.  Points were given for drinks consumed (don’t drink kids...) and photos taken on the night.

The biggest outcome of this was that it lead into developing a [similar app](http://eightandfour.com/christmas-drinkup/) to compliment eight&four’s Drink Up networking events.

## Find Seek
Find Seek was a development of the original TDF game, but was built on top of Angular and used local storage for authentication and session persistence.  The game was more linear, with a series of mini games and intermittent drink prompts.

Players were given a pin which logged them into their personalised account, complete with pixel art avatar.  The games included finding the matching team member in a grid of upturned avatars and solving anagrams.
