Built the weekend after a week of hilly cycling, this little Strava API integrated app was the perfect opportunity to test my [Strava PHP Client](/projects/github/) in the wild.

The app was built around a week long challenge where Strava users were asked to climb (number) meters  with their bike in celebration of the Tour De France.

Strava is a great tool for recording and analysing rides, but I felt it was falling short when presenting data from their challenges.  I decided I could do better than a simple progress percentage bar and decided to create an infographic inspired single page app with PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

I wanted to approach the app interface from the perspective of non Strava users. Taking the data and presenting it in a more meaningful and detailed way by breaking it down into digestible units. The motivation was to create a clean and beautiful interface for any Strava user's challenge attempt.

The app was built in a weekend and had over 70 users connect with it.  It was personally satisfying to get some great feedback from other users and has spurred me on to create more interesting Strava integrations in the future.
