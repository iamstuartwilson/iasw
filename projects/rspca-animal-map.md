Built whilst at eight&four, this mobile first site formed the backbone of a campaign to generate national awareness for the services provided by the RSPCA whilst actively involving their supporters across different social media channels.

The RSPCA wanted to involve their supporters by offering a platform for users to upload photos of their pets and place them on a map. The website was intended to be a celebration of this pet loving nation and certainly confirmed that we are true animal lovers with over 3000 uploads in the first week!

The website was built over 2 weeks using the Google Maps API with Angular on top of a WordPress installation for content management and submission moderation.  It received over 2000 uploads in the weekend of it's launch.  That's a lot of kittens!
